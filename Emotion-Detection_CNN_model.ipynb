output layer to EfficientNetV2M model \n\n1] We are storing the output of last convolutional layer to feed fully connected layer. \nbefore feeding the output of last convolutional layer to fully connected layer we need to onvert 3d tensor to 1d tensor as fully connected layer accepts input in 1d form. We are using **GlobalAveragePooling2D** to flatten the output of last convolutional layer. \n\nGlobalAveragePooling2D() function works same as flatten(), only difference is flatten() maintain all the features of convolutional layer and GlobalAveragePooling2D() takes avarage of all the feature maps \nFor tensor shape like (8, 8, 1280) it will take average of 8X8 features maps (1280) , which will convert tesnsor into (batch_szie X no_of_feature_maps) i.e 4x1280 in our case.\n\n**GlobalAveragePooling2D** helps to reduce intense tensor shape which can cause overfitting to our model.\n\n\n2] We are adding dense layers to create fully connected network after flattenning tensor shape using GlobalAveragePooling2D layer.\n\n3] **Dropout layer**: I have used dropout layer to overcome overfitting in a model. Dropout layers unuses no. of neurons for that epoch randomly, this helps to focus on each and every pattern instead of some fixed patterns, this reduce dependancy of neurons from previous layers, introduce different neural architecture by dropping neurons randomly.\n\n\n4] **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization helps to speed up and stabilize training of any neural network model.\nIn batch normalization we are trying to reduce the effect of \"Internal Covariate Shift\" which causes delay in convergenece of model towards global minima. \nInternal Covariate Shift is the change in the distribution of network activations due to the chang in network parameter during training.\n\nIn deep neural network activation of neurons depends upon w and b parameter of network which keeps changing throughout the training of model which causes change in distribution. For this we have to keep learnin rate (n) bery slow which causes slow training.\n\nBatch-normalization is works only with mini-batch and its applied before relu i.e non-linear activation function.\nIt normalizes the activation of neurons by calaculating mean and variance of mini-batch data and apply stardard deviation. It uses Gamma and beta learnable paraetrs which apply scale and shift method to input of activations function.\n\n5] **Activation fucntion**: we are using **elu** activation function for all the fully connected networks hidden layers and softmax activation fucntion for output layer as we have to predict 7 categories of emotions.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense,Dropout,Activation,Flatten,BatchNormalization, GlobalAveragePooling2D, GlobalMaxPooling2D\nfrom keras.models import Model\n\n\nx = conv_base_EffiecientNetv2M.output\nx = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)\n# let's add a fully-connected layer\nx = Dense(3000, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(2024, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(1050, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(1000, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(562, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(200, activation='elu')(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)\nx = BatchNormalization()(x)\nx = Dense(100, activation='elu')(x)\n# and a logistic layer -- let's say we have 200 classes\npredictions = Dense(7, activation='softmax')(x)\n\n# this is the model we will train\nmodel_Efficientnetv2M = Model(inputs=conv_base_EffiecientNetv2M.input, outputs=predictions)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Callback\n\n**ModelCheckpoint :** We need to save weights of model whle training for future use, for this we need to create modelcheckpoint.
